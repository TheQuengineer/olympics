    "\n",
    "Our model can be made accessbile via a simple web portal for users of all kinds. Our specific audiences would be individuals that would like to determine which olympic sport they would be most fit for based on specific attributes that they give the web application. A aspiring athlete that would like to one day join the olympics could go to our system to get a quick recommendation for the sport he or she can fit into based on body type. Unfortunately, our model takes up 2.4GB of space in a machines memory. This makes it difficult to deploy the model on most machines especially mobile apps. Any interested party would need to have a comprehensive plan designed to deploy this model at scale so as to not sacrifice accuracy. This size limitation could limit the use to a mass audience. \n",

    "`The Goal`\n",

    "The goal of the model is to accurately and successfully predict the most likely olympic sport that is most fitting for the user. A user could take this information and act on it by beginning to start the process of training for the ideal sport in order to one day make the olympics. This application cannot however, gaurantee that a user will make the olympics, but it can give a user some insight on the sport that might be most suitable for the individuals success if he or she ever decided to go into the olympic games as a career option. Using this stystem is much better than shooting in the dark by selecting a sport by chance without any data to back the decision. In order for us to determine whether or not we acheived our goal we would need to study real world use cases of the system on real people. Our success would be determined by how well those people performed in their respective sports chosen by the algorithm. We would be interested in whether or not the sport chosen by the model was indeed a good fit for the user and lead to an overall successfull career in the olympic games.\n",

The age range that we look at is anyone between the age of *10* and *90* (Though 90 years is not typical based on the olympic data, but there has been anomalies in this age group througout olympic history). Our interested parties would take the information from our model and hopefully develop a career based on our findings. Coaches and Personal trainors could also make use of this model as they could use it to help their clients determine what olympic sport to design their exercises around for a specific clients body type. The applications for this model are far reaching within the athletics arena.\n",

    "`Deploying The Model`\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model takes up about 2.4GB worth of memory on disk. In order to have a successful release of the model we would need to consider a cloud solution that would allow access to users that wanted consultation with the model. A good way to deploy this is to center the model around a olympic sport consultancy business. This vertical would allow future athletes to come to the consultancy and give us their athletic data. This athletic data could then be fed to the model and the model could give back a detailed report of the most optimal sport for the users success in the olympics. A part of the business could be designed to do a follow up on all the athletes that had consultations by the system. The follow up data would then be used to feed back into the system to make better and better predictions for current and future athletes. Overtime this defensible business could obtain proprietary olympic data which no one else would have. A successful deployment of this model in the real world could lead to obtaining the business of only the best athletes, and because of their success, more athletes of high caliber would consult with our model, which will in turn create a constant loop of successful olympians along with their data points that made those specific olympians successful. This could lead to a viable olympic consultancy unmatched by anyone.\n",
