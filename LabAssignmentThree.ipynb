    "For our dataset this semester we selected the [\"120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results\"](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) dataset from Kaggle. This dataset tracks all Olympians' medal results from 1896-2016, as well as various physical attributes such as `gender`, `age`, `weight`, and `height`. This dataset was originally collected for various analyses, such as whether host countries' athletes win more medals, and to track the involvement of women in the Olympics from various countries over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intent this semester was to focus on analyzing the physical attributes of the Olympians over time, when they are available. We determined the trends around `gender`, `age`, `height`, and `weight` in sports over time, and if they seemed to be trending to some kind of \"ideal ratio\" for each sport. We eliminated linear regression as a viable option, since any non-zero slope would trend to positive or negative infinity, and long-term extrapolation would quickly become absurd. We attempted quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic regression in order to derive meaningful insights from the data. To consider our analysis \"successful\", our target was to explain at least 80% of the variablity in the data with our regression model. We also looked at how these ratios compare to the average person in order to see which Olympic sports might be the most accessible from a body size perspective. Finally, we constructed a means to analyze our team members' own body types and see for which Olympic sports we might be best-suited, strictly from a `sex`, `age`, `weight`, and `height` perspectives."

    "Our model can be made accessible via a simple web portal for users of all kinds. Our specific audiences would be individuals that would like to determine which Olympic sport they would be most fit for based on specific attributes that they give the web application. An aspiring athlete that would like to one day join the Olympics could go to our system to get a quick recommendation for the sport he or she can fit into based on body type. Unfortunately, our model takes up 2.4GB of space in a machine's memory. This makes it difficult to deploy the model on most machines especially mobile apps. Any interested party would need to have a comprehensive plan designed to deploy this model at scale to not sacrifice accuracy. This size limitation could limit the use to a mass audience. \n",

A user could take this information and act on it by beginning to start the process of training for the ideal sport in order to one day make the Olympics. This application cannot however, guarantee that a user will make the Olympics, but it can give a user some insight on the sport that might be most suitable for the individuals success if he or she ever decided to go into the Olympic games as a career option. Using this system is much better than shooting in the dark by selecting a sport by chance without any data to back the decision. For us to determine whether or not we achieved our goal we would need to study real world use cases of the system on real people. Our success would be determined by how well those people performed in their respective sports chosen by the algorithm. We would be interested in whether the sport chosen by the model was indeed a good fit for the user and lead to an overall successful performance in the Olympic games.\n",

    "Our model could be most useful to future athletes. The age range that we look at is anyone between the age of *10* and *90* (Though 90 years is not typical based on the Olympic data, but there has been anomalies in this age group throughout Olympic history). Our interested parties would take the information from our model and hopefully develop a career based on our findings. Coaches and personal trainers could also make use of this model as they could use it to help their clients determine what Olympic sport to design their exercises around for a specific client's body type. The applications for this model are far reaching within the athletics arena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally this model would help world-class athletes transition between sports for optimal success. There has been precendent;  for example, American football and track star Sam McGuffie transitioned into being a member of the United States Olympic Men's Bobsleigh Team for the 2018 Olympics Games where his physical attributes made him an ideal push crewman and brakeman.\n",

    "`Deploying The Model`\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model takes up about 2.4GB worth of memory on disk. In order to have a successful release of the model we would need to consider a cloud solution that would allow access to users that wanted consultation with the model. A good way to deploy this is to center the model around a Olympic sport consultancy business. This vertical would allow future athletes to come to the consultancy and give us their athletic data. This athletic data could then be fed to the model and the model could give back a detailed report of the most optimal sport for the user's success in the Olympics. A part of the business could be designed to do a follow up on all the athletes that had consultations by the system. The follow up data would then be used to feed back into the system to make better and better predictions for current and future athletes. Over time this defensible business could obtain proprietary Olympic data which no one else would have. A successful deployment of this model in the real world could lead to obtaining the business of only the best athletes, and because of their success, more athletes of high caliber would consult with our model, which will in turn create a constant loop of successful Olympians along with their data points that made those specific Olympians successful. This could lead to a viable Olympic consultancy unmatched by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Data that should be collected`\n",
    "\n",
    "The longer this model goes in production the more data points we could have to constantly improve the predictions. Some of the new data points we would be interested in collecting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of times appeared in the Olympics for those that used our model\n",
    "- Average age of first Olympic appearance for those that used our model\n",
    "- Average age of first Olympic podium finish for those that used our model\n",
    "- Most recommended sports by our model? What is the pattern that would emerge here overtime?\n",
    "- Average number of times our athlete quit after getting a recommendation from our model\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these metrics, an attribute rating system by sport would need to be developed to match athlete skillsets to sport requirements. After collecting `gender`, `age`, `weight`, and `height` the model would collect 1-10 ratings on `depth perception`, `hand-eye`, `jump`, and `stamina` per athlete and compare against an ideal rating per sport. Consider the long jump for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Characteristic | Ideal Rating |\n",
    "| ---------------- | -- | \n",
    "| Depth Perception | 5  |\n",
    "| Hand-Eye         | 2  |\n",
    "| Jump             | 10 |\n",
    "| Stamina          | 6  |\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics would be good factors in measuring the why or why not of success around our recommendations. This feedback could be used to make our models prediction better. Ultimately, we would like to be able to help all consulted athletes win gold in their events on a consistent basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "`How often the model should be updated`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the best success our model should be updated every 2 to 4 years coinciding with the new Olympic data that is captured. We are fortunate enough to be in a domain that doesn't happen as often as most domains so there would not be a need for real-time updates."
